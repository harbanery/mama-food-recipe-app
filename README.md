## Usage

This application is a portfolio that inspired from this [Figma template](https://www.figma.com/design/SUbBTYCq1e4ngRt20lSdqr/Food-Recipe?node-id=47-1273&t=zKQHFrZI17X3NJUQ-0). The programming used in this application is Next.js with React components utilizing router pages. Additionally, I used Tailwind as CSS Framework, with enhancements such as CLSX and ESLint to improve efficiency and maintain code consistency. I also used Axios for API calls, while date-fns and js-cookie manage date handling and cookies. For developing my authentication and other validations, I used Yup for schema validation. Lastly, Redux is implemented for state management, completing the overall project of this application.
